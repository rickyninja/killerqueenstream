# Hardware Watchlist

I'm pretty sure I'm hitting the USB 2.0 limit on rPi.  Looking at some alternatives that may prove to fit this project better.

  This board shares form factor with rPi, and possibly power supply.

  Not much info on this beyond specs.  Not for sale yet. $165 pre-order, $190 back-order.  4 USB 3.0 ports.
